        "description": "<p>For almost six decades, Breton has been driven by the purpose of materializing dreams. We were born with our gaze turned towards authentic Brazilian design and have continued, over the years, celebrating the cultural richness of our country in every curve, texture, and finish. Each piece of furniture we create carries the soul of Brazil: bold, welcoming, diverse, and human.<br>&nbsp;<br>Our commitment goes beyond aesthetics. We believe that design can, and should, be a tool for transformation. That's why we combine artisanal tradition and innovation with environmental responsibility, becoming pioneers in the sector by achieving the carbon-negative company seal. This is how we design the future: with consciousness, beauty, and purpose.<br><br>At the heart of everything is the customer. We create personalized furniture and experiences, with a careful curation by a multidisciplinary team dedicated to listening attentively and delivering tailor-made solutions. Each piece offers infinite possibilities for customization in measurements, fabrics, and finishes. <br><br>Today, we have 19 stores spread across Brazil, in addition to our international flagship in Dubai — a bridge between Brazilian design and the world. And we continue to grow: by 2026, four more units will reinforce this expansion movement, always with the same commitment to excellence, sustainability, and the appreciation of national identity.</p><p><br></p>",
