It is a more ambitious goal than neutrality, where the impact of emissions is fully offset.&nbsp;</p><p>By adopting practices that avoid, reduce, and its emissions, Breton moves towards a production model with less impact and greater responsibility.</p><p>Since 2020, the company has been carbon neutral. And starting in 2022, it began offsetting more than it emits, reaching the level of carbon negative. The assessment is carried out through the carbon inventory calculated by The Planet, a sustainability consulting company.</p>"
